Nice the doxygen documentation. You may create a personalised Doxygen file to make a nice reference manual.

The gravitatinal forse is inverse proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects, not the cube. The same for the electric force. You are using the cube. Am I missing something? 

For the rest the code is fine. Good use of inheritance and template. Maybe one could try different timea advancing methods than the Euler one.
